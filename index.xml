      <description>Referencing documentation is a core task for developers.
 Documentation communicates how something (in our case programming languages, software libraries) works.
 Good documentation reduces implementation time and increases predictability of our software programs.
  We will be referring to the following list of the documentation resources frequently throughout the course:
HTML MDN&amp;rsquo;s HTML Reference
CSS MDN&amp;rsquo;s CSS Reference
Javascript MDN&amp;rsquo;s Javascript Reference
jQuery jQuery Documentation</description>

 Why?: Text editor is a program that developers use to create and edit a range of programming language files. We&amp;rsquo;ll be using Atom, because it&amp;rsquo;s open source (free) and really good.
 Download Atom
  Browser:
 Why?: Google chrome is a robust browser with a variety of tools that are helpful to developers.
 Install Google Chrome
  Github:
 Why?: Github (and Git) are tools/applications used to by developers to manage their code and work collaboratively with each other.</description>

      <description>Recommended Folder Organization  Create a folder in your Documents folder (My Documents on Windows) called jsd
 At beginning of every class, you&amp;rsquo;ll use git (this process will be explained in the next class) to download any starter files to your jsd folder are available for that day&amp;rsquo;s lesson
 As the course progresses you&amp;rsquo;ll have a neatly organized listing of all of your work that looks similar to this:</description>

2) Open up your console / terminal
 For Mac OS X users:
 Open the &amp;ldquo;Terminal&amp;rdquo; app (Applications &amp;gt; Utilities &amp;gt; Terminal)  For Windows:
 Open the &amp;ldquo;Command Prompt&amp;rdquo; application.   3) In the terminal type the following command to confirm git was successfully installed:</description>

      <description> What is Programming?  List of instructions that a computer needs in order to complete a task
 Instructions are provided in a programming language that the computer understands
 These set of instructions are commonly referred as source code or a program
 There are many programming languages available, during this course we will be learning JavaScript

      <description>Do your homework: More you practice the concepts learned in class, the faster you&amp;rsquo;ll pick them up
 Don&amp;rsquo;t try to memorize anything: You&amp;rsquo;ll memorize things naturally through the act of doing things over and over again. Besides, if you don&amp;rsquo;t remember something just look it up (i.e. google).
 Work smarter not harder: In additional to looking things up, developers are really good at referencing past code that they&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past to solve problems they encounter in the present.</description>

 It was created in 10 days
 Not the same as Java
  What does JavaScript do?  Adds interactivity to your websites

      <description> Pseudocode  Process of writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language
 Mixture of natural language and high-level programming concepts
 There is no standard way to write pseudocode, use langauge that can be understood by technical and non-technical people
 Use pseudocode as an &amp;ldquo;outline&amp;rdquo; for your real code
